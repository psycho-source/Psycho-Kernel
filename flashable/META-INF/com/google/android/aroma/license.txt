I am not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards, Parents Scolding, thermonuclear war, 
A Zombie Apocalypse or you getting fired because the alarm app failed. Please do some research 
if you have any concerns about features included in this KERNEL
before flashing it! YOU are choosing to make these modifications, and if
you point your finger at me for messing up your device, I will laugh at you.
If you need help then simply report the problem you facing on my thread "with logs"
and wait for me to fix it!
